# Nextstrain Counts

Internal tooling for the Nextstrain team to curate and standardize various counts data such as COVID-19 case counts and SARS-CoV-2 clade sequence counts.

## Data Sources

- Global COVID-19 case counts: [Our World in Data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv), originally from [JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
- USA state COVID-19 case counts: [U.S. State-Level Data from The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)
- SARS-CoV-2 sequences: Nextstrain-curated metadata TSVs for GISAID and GenBank produced by [nextstrain/ncov-ingest](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov-ingest)

## Outputs

> :warning: **WARNING: This is an alpha release.** Output file format and address may change at any time

This repository produces multiple TSVs that are routinely uploaded to a public AWS S3 bucket: `s3://nextstrain-data/files/workflows/forecasts-ncov`.

The case counts are stored at `s3://nextstrain-data/files/workflows/forecasts-ncov/cases/`.
The GISAID outputs are stored at `s3://nextstrain-data/files/workflows/forecasts-ncov/gisaid/`.
The open (GenBank) outputs are stored at `s3://nextstrain-data/files/workflows/forecasts-ncov/open/`.

Within each data provenance, the files are split by clade type and geographic resolution.
Within TSVs at the global resolution, the `location` column contains countries.
Within TSVs at the country resolution, the `location` column contains divisions (e.g. states for US).
